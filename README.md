## Topic Title: Rural Coastal Hazard Mitigation

## Introductory background information: 

Florencia's Capstone Studio Project: Coastal Community Adaptation: Planning and Designing Upland Expansion and Relocation

The current capstone studio project I am in examines strategies for hazard mitigation in rural coastal regions. The scope of the project is intentionally broad, reflecting the complexity of governance structures in rural coastal communities. The research draws on relevant case studies to inform planning and design approaches that address coastal hazards and long-term community resilience.

Rural coastal communities are primarily served by county governments, which function as the local governing authority for areas outside incorporated city limits. However, a significant gap often exists between county governments and rural communities due to disparities in resources, limited institutional capacity, and differing local needs. Many rural coastal communities are particularly vulnerable and under-resourced, making it difficult for county governments to adequately serve them. This disconnect can contribute to the decline of rural coastal communities and the deterioration of local economies.

## Short 1-2 sentence summary
Rural coastal hazard mitigation is therefore a critical planning priority. I plan to develop an interactive web mapping tool that can support this effort by enhancing public education and awareness of local hazards and available mitigation strategies. Such a tool can assist both county governments and residents in identifying areas for improvement by visualizing risks related to coastal erosion and flooding using NDarrays - raster time series analysis.


## Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s):
Our objective is to develop an interactive web mapping tool for county governments and residents in identifying areas for improvement by visualizing risks related to coastal erosion and flooding.
