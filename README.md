## Topic Title: Rural Coastal Hazard Mitigation

## Introductory background information: 

Florencia's Capstone Studio Project: Coastal Community Adaptation: Planning and Designing Upland Expansion and Relocation

The current capstone studio project examines strategies for hazard mitigation in rural coastal regions. The scope of work is centered in Washington's Coastal region, especially in Westport and Grayland. As coastal erosion occurs due to intense winter storms, high-engery waves, and other climate related factors. Home owners and communities in the rural coastal areas face the problem of losing their communities and home ownership.

Rural coastal communities are primarily served by county governments, which function as the local governing authority for areas outside incorporated city limits. However, a significant gap often exists between county governments and rural communities due to disparities in resources, limited institutional capacity, and differing local needs. Many rural coastal communities are particularly vulnerable and under-resourced, making it difficult for county governments to adequately serve them. This disconnect can contribute to the decline of rural coastal communities and the deterioration of local economies.

## Short 1-2 sentence summary
Rural coastal hazard mitigation is a critical planning priority. By developing an interactive web mapping tool that can support this effort by enhancing public education and awareness of local hazards and available mitigation strategies. Such a tool can assist both county governments and residents in identifying areas for improvement by visualizing risks related to coastal erosion and flooding.

## Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s):
Our objective is to develop an interactive web mapping tool for county governments and residents in identifying areas for improvement by visualizing risks related to coastal erosion and flooding. Tentatively we are considering looking at Washington coastal communities of Westport and Grayland and would like to compile 19 year tidal data and satellite images of the coastline to map shoreline change due to erosion. To get a better understanding of communities that are affected by coastal erosion and flooding a layer showing census data will display demographics impacted.
